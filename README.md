# EscapeRoomPJ-C

For the project of the 'Computer Networks' course I developed a client-server application that implements the escape-room game, in a digital scenario.<br>
In the pdf documentation, are explained the implementation details and choices taken during the design, such as the communication protocols used, the type of server, the mode of data exchange.
